name: Cypress Load Balancer - Save temporary spec map after Cypress test run
description: |
  After a Cypress test job runs, this action is used to save a temporary spec map file that can
  be merged back to a base load balancing map with new results, which can be used on next load balancing.

  If using in a job that runs tests, this action should be run regardless if tests failed.

  Usage:
  After your Cypress tests are completed in a job, add this action.
  The "cypress-load-balancer" plugin must be installed in your Cypress project.

runs:
  using: composite
  steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4

    - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
      with:
        node-version: 20.18.x

    - name: Generate uuid to use uploading a unique load balancer map artifact
      id: generate-uuid
      run: echo uuid="$(uuidgen)" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
      shell: bash

    - name: Upload temp load balancer map
      if: always()
